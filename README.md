The Statistics on Smoking in England report aims to present a broad picture of health issues relating to smoking in England and covers topics such as smoking prevalence, habits, behaviours, and attitudes, smoking-related health issues and mortality, and associated costs. 
Conditions that could be caused by smoking resulted in 1.7 million admissions to hospitals in England, for adults aged 35 and over, in 2014-2015 -- an average of 4,700 admissions per day! 
These figures refer to admissions with a primary diagnosis of a disease that can be caused by smoking, but for which smoking may or may not have actually been the cause.
